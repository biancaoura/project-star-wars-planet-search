# Star Wars Planet Search Project

## Goals

### Develop a planet search application


- Fetch API without the `residents` key

- While typing in the input, filter the matching planets

- Filter by `column options`, `comparison` and `value` when button is clicked
  - If a `column` is already been used, it won't be rendered in the dropdown menu

- Render a list with all the applied filters, with individual buttons to remove the target filter

- Sort by `column options`, ascending or descending order

- Button to remove all filters

- Table rendering the planets with the optional filters


### Develop tests for 100% coverage
